## Before start

I checked if I have java on my computer. I was happy to see that, openJDK was already installed.

## Task 1.: Creating a simple application, that says "Hello Sagemcom"

I never used or wrote a program code in java, so I looked up how a basic "Hello word" program is written. I found a [website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beginning-java-programming-with-hello-world-example/), that walked me through how to solve this task.<br/>
When I tried to compile my program, I got an error message. Is solved it by installing "default-jdk". After that I tried to compile it again, but got another error. This error was about my code, so I got closer. I fixed my bug, and I managed to compile the code. I got another error, because I didn't define a main method. I went back to my code, fixed this mistake, and then compiled the code again.<br/>
Now my first java code is running and write out the correct message.

## Task 2.: Compile code using maven
