/*
 * What is Armstrong number? An Armstrong number is an n-digit number that is
 * equal to the sum of the nth powers of its digits.
 * 
 * Let's demonstrate this for a 4-digit number: 1634 is a 4-digit number, raise
 * each digit to the fourth power, and add: 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1634, so it
 * is an Armstrong number. For a 3-digit number: 153 is a 3-digit number, raise
 * each digit to the third power, and add: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153, so it is an
 * Armstrong number. Exercise Write a simple program to check if a given number
 * is an armstrong number. The program should ask for a number. E.g. if we type
 * 371, the program should print out: The 371 is an Armstrong number.
